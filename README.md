# Fluent
Fluent rainmeter theme, which is inspired from and some source imported from [SysDash](https://github.com/marcopixel/SysDash).

## Usage
Please install rmskin from [releases](https://github.com/HelloWorld017/Fluent/releases)

### Drive
You can change the drive letter in `Fluent/@Resources/Variables.inc`

### Media
The [WebNowPlaying](https://github.com/tjhrulz/WebNowPlaying) is set as default and you should install browser plugin in order to work.  
You can change to GPMDP / Spotify / NowPlaying but they are not tested.

### Temperature
You should install [OpenHardwareMonitor](https://github.com/openhardwaremonitor/openhardwaremonitor) / [LibreHardwareMonitor](https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor/) and check **Remote Web Server > Run** to work.  
I recommend LibreHardwareMonitor as it supports Ryzen and much more updated than OpenHardwareMonitor.

### Weather
You can change your location and unit in `Fluent/@Resources/Variables.inc`
